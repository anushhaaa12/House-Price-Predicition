## House Price Prediction
## Overview
This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques. It leverages various features like location, size, and number of bedrooms to build and evaluate models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Model Training: Training and evaluating models for accurate house price prediction.

Visualization: Visualizing data and model performance.

## Technologies Used
Python

Scikit-learn

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI) with features like house size, location, and age to predict the target variable (price).

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook (house_price_prediction.ipynb) or Python script (train_model.py) to train and evaluate the models.

## Installation
```bash
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/anushhaaa12/house-price-prediction.git

## Install dependencies:
--bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
